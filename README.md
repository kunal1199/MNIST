# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This project creates a Deep Neural Network with 4 hidden layers (1500 nodes each) to train and test against the MNIST Handwritten Digit dataset.
The project also uses Convolution Neural Networks with 2 hidden layers against the MNIST dataset
Lastly, this project uses Recurrent Neural Networks approach on the same MNIST data

## Getting Started

This project uses the Tensorflow Library in Python and uses Deep Neural Networks and Convolution Neural Networks

### Prerequisites

1. Tensorflow 1.0
2. Python 2.7
3. NVIDIA CUDA GPU (Optional)

### Installing
